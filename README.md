# landing-page

The goal of this project is to exercise my creativity and gain further experience developing websites. I designed the logo on the top left that says "Cameron Posey's Portfolio" and added it because I like the matching color. This website doesn't look beautiful, as my main goal was to gain experience with flexbox before moving on in The Odin Project curriculum.
